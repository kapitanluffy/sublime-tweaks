Ever wondered when will that [feature request](https://github.com/sublimehq/sublime_text/issues) be worked on?
Or wondered why can't you do that thing without using your mouse?

Tweaks is a collection of several python scripts that would improve your workflow and quality of life! 🌞

I am still lazy to screen capture each tweak but I promise you they ~~kinda~~ work. If you have a tweak in mind, let me know on discord or create an issue here. Also, thank you to all the wonderful people on [discord](http://discord.sublimetext.io/)! Credits are included in the code.
